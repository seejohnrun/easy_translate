## EasyTranslate

This is a Ruby library for Google Translate that makes working with bulk calls,
user_ips and access via API Key easy.

---

### Installation

```bash
$ gem install easy_translate
```

Or in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'easy_translate'
```

---

## Single translation

```ruby
# auto-detect
EasyTranslate.translate('Hello, world', to: :spanish) # => "Hola, mundo"
EasyTranslate.translate('Hello, world', to: 'es') # => "Hola, mundo"

# feel free to specify explicitly
EasyTranslate.translate('Hola, mundo', from: :spanish, to: :en) # => "Hello, world"
```

## Batch translation (Yay!)

```ruby
# multiple strings
EasyTranslate.translate(['Hello', 'Goodbye'], to: :spanish) # => ["¡Hola", "Despedida"]
```

## API Keys

```ruby
# make google happy - (NOTE: use these anywhere)
EasyTranslate.translate('Hello, world', to: :es, key: 'xxx')

# don't want to set the key on every call? ** Me either! **
EasyTranslate.api_key = 'xxx'
```

## You want language detection too?

```ruby
# detect language
EasyTranslate.detect "This is definitely English!" # => 'en'
```

## Batch detection (Woohoo!)

```ruby
# detect language
EasyTranslate.detect ['Hello World', '我姓譚'] # => ['en', 'zh-CN']
```

## Need confidence in your detections?

```ruby
# detect language with confidence
EasyTranslate.detect "This is definitely English!", confidence: true # => { :language => 'en', :confidence => 0.77272725 }
```

```ruby
# detect batch languages with confidence
EasyTranslate.detect ['This is definitely English!', '我姓譚'], confidence: true # => [{ :language => 'en', :confidence => 0.77272725 }, { :language => 'zh-CN', :confidence => 1.0 }]
```

## Explicitly select translation model (NMT, PBMT)
Google Translate now replaces Phrase Based Machine Translation (PBMT) with Neural Machine Translation (NMT) automatically where possible. If you prefer PBMT or need to compare the results, you can use the `model:` parameter with either `nmt` or `base` to force the model selection:

```ruby
EasyTranslate.translate("El cuervo americano es un ave con plumas negras iridiscentes sobre todo su cuerpo.", from: "es", to: "en", model: "nmt")
 # => "The American Raven is a bird with iridescent black feathers over its entire body."
 ```

 ```ruby
EasyTranslate.translate("El cuervo americano es un ave con plumas negras iridiscentes sobre todo su cuerpo.", from: "es", to: "en", model: "base")
# => "The American crow is a bird with iridescent black feathers over her body."
```

See https://research.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html for more background

## Google Translate supports HTML (default) and plain text formats

```ruby
EasyTranslate.translate "Las doce en punto", format: 'text', to: :en
# => "Twelve o'clock"
EasyTranslate.translate "Las doce <b>en punto</b>", format: 'html', to: :en
# => "Twelve <b>o&#39;clock</b>"
```

---

## A note on concurrency as of v0.4.0

Due to limitations with the Google Translate batch API, above a certain
number of translations - this library will begin making calls concurrently.

The default concurrency is 4, but if you'd prefer to run without threads,
you can set `:concurrency => 1` to run the translation calls serially.

---

## List of languages

```ruby
# list from <http://translate.google.com/>
EasyTranslate::LANGUAGES # => { 'en' => 'english', ... }
```

### List of supported languages

```ruby
# List all languages (from API)
EasyTranslate.translations_available

# List all languages supported by some language
EasyTranslate.translations_available('zh-CN')
```
